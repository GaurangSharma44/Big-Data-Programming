2. Keep pointer on index [0] on both the strings.
3. Check if S1[0] matches with S2[0],
	if yes, increment S1 and S2 by 1.
	if not, increment only S2 by 1.
4. Keep incrementing S2 by 1 till it matches any character on S1 (where pointer is).
5. If S2 exhausts, reset the pointer of S2 back where it matched last and increment S1 by 1.
6. If there is a character match, push the character to "S3".
7. Print S3 and the length of S3.
8. If there is no match, then print that the LCS is "Null".
